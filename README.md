# Beginner Renderer J_Kodak

I will create a simple renderer from zero as a beginner of graphics. All updates will be shown in this repository.

------
### Instruction

Use `Select Model` button to find and select your OBJ file.

Use `Render` button to render the model on the screen.

[Latest release version](release/240713release.zip)

### 13/07/2024 Update

<img src="images/240713version.png" alt="240713version" style="zoom:50%;" />

Today, I add a log window at the right bottom of the main window. It will show you whether the model selection and rendering are successful or not. And I implement the rendering of a single OBJ file. As you see, the African head model is rendered on the screen successfully! [Release version](release/240713release.zip)

### 12/07/2024 Update

<img src="images/240712version.png" alt="240712version" style="zoom:50%;" />

Today, I complete the initialization of the renderer UI. The image will be set to black when the renderer start to work. Then you can use "Select Model" button to select your model (OBJ file).
